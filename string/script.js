/*

You can create strings with " or '
.length is a property that gives you the length of a string
.toUpperCase() is a function that converts the string to upper case
.toLowerCase() is a function that converts the string to lower case
parentheses () on functions are required. .length is a property that is already pre-computed; therefore, it does not need parentheses.
console.log(...) is used for debugging and is NOT a replacement for return.
