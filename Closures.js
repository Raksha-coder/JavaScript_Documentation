/*
ðŸŒŸWhat is Closure?
A closure is the combination of a function 
bundled together with its lexical environment(surrounding state).
in other words, a closure gives you access to an outer  function scope
from an inner function.

ðŸŒŸUses Of Closures:
- Module Design Patterns
- Currying

- memoize
- maintaining state in async world
- setTimeouts
- Iterators
